# Election_analysis
Overview: We were asked to provide a written analysis of the election audit for the election commission. We have already gathered information on candidate votes (percentages and winning). The election commission is asking for new results for the voter turnout for each county, percentage of  votes from each county out of the total count and county with the highest turnout. The request also include that we have a clearly written outline overview of the analysis methodologies.

##Requirements and Details of the Analysis
1. For this challenge, we are to use for loops and conditional statements with membership and logical operators to find the requested results. Then, print the results tot he command line and save them to a text file. 

2. We were to initialize a county list and dictionaries that will hold county names, the key and votes cast for each county as the value.

3. Write a for loop script that gets the county name from each row and decision statement with a logical operator to check if the county name acquires is in the county list. If not, it shouldd be added to the county list. Start tracking the vounty votes, initializing it to zero. 

4. Write a script that calculates the county's votes as a percentage of the total votes

5. Write a script that print the current county, its percentage of the total votes, and its total votes to the command line. Determine the winning county. Write a script to print and save results in a text file.
